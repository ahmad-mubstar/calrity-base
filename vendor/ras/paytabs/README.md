_The following note was provided by Aya by email but was added through her account after she left:_

- PayTabs has applied some mandatory API updates, I have updated the extension to contain these updates on the following commit:
https://bitbucket.org/shopgo/paytabs-payment-module/commits/35c3a70aa83bf8cf04514ea9152b78df0c4b1308

- Another important note about PayTabs Sadad:
PayTabs has developed an extension for Sadad Bank, we have suffered from the non-working and non-stable versions they delivered. Finally they delivered a better version of Sadad and it's now installed on http://shop.medicaloutfit.com/medsadad/
It's not on the live store yet because Sadad needs to confirm the environment before, which seems to take longer than expected.

- PayTabs, will publish a newer version of Sadad and it needs to be throughly checked and tested before adding to any ShopGo store or BitBucket.
