This directory should be used to place your custom theme customization.
This allows you to more easily implement future updates.

We recommend that you place your customizations in subdirectories called css, images and js as follows:

  skin/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/css     -  contains CSS files
  skin/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/images  -  contains images
  skin/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/js      -  contains JavaScript files
