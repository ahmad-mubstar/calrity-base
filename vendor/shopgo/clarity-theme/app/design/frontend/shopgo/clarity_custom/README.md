This directory should be used to place your custom theme customization.
This allows you to more easily implement future updates.

These customizations should be placed in subdirectories called layout, template and locale as follows:

  app/design/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/layout    -  contains XML files which define pages structure
  app/design/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/template  -  contains template .phtml files
  app/design/frontend/shopgo/clarity_custom/locale    -  contains CSV files with translations
